            Gadge Baba Amravati University SGBAU) in 1982. The Institute started
            with three basic disciplines Civil, Mechanical and Electrical
            Engineering initially. Subsequently new degree programs in
            Electronic & Telecommunication, Computer Science & Engineering,
            Instrumentation Engineering and Information Technology were added as
            per the demand, need and requirements of the country. The institute
            started part time Post Graduate course in Electrical Power System in
            1986 and later added four P.G. Courses in Thermal Power Engineering,
            Environmental, Geotechnical, and Electronics Systems and
            Communication.
            <br /> The institute now offers seven full time PG programs in
            Electrical Power Systems, Structures, Thermal Power Engineering.,
            Environmental Engineering., Advanced Electronics, Computer
            Engineering and Geotechnical Engineering. <br />
            Besides imparting Engineering education in all major Disciplines, it
            is also a recognized research center for Ph.D. Programs in Civil,
            Mechanical, Electrical, Electronics and Computer Engineering for
            Amravati University. The total student strength is around 1,700.
